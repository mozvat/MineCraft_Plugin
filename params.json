If you wish to join this initiative, reach out on the forum expressing interest. Initially, the third goal will be focused on @rhanson vision defined below.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add a driving narrative that provides simple goals to the player and tracks progress toward those goals.  To serve the purpose of the narrative I have in mind I think we will need 2 new blocks.  The narrative will consist of vague messages that the player will receive when he interacts with objects that are generated within the world, for now I'll call these blocks, \"IO Blocks\".  IO blocks will need to send the player simple messages like, \"We desperately need Dirt\".  I think a block that sends the player a message when they stand near it would serve this purpose.  It may be useful if we could define a sequence of messages per unique block that can be overriden by a story script. Collection and delivery could be handled by right-clicking on the block and placing the objects in an interface similar to the crafting workbench.  The next block would be what I would call the \"Tech Block\".  This would be one of the blocks that the player is rewarded with for his collections.  Tech blocks will be a building block for the player to construct high tech styled buildings, but for now I don't have any additional functionality in mind.  \r\n\r\nI realize this is getting long, but I'm in the groove ;)  So, as far as looks go, I imagine the IO block to be a tall, white, glowing monolith, sort of the opposite of the 2001 space odyssey monolith.  The Tech Block would be an Apple inspired block.  I think it could be glossy black with some sort of glowing symbol in the center of each face, like an atom, rather that an apple.  I should have no trouble creating the art for these objects.  I would also like to have some animated aspects to the comm and IO blocks.\r\n\r\nThe narrative and objectives will be intentionally simple.  The overarching story will be based on the player being kept in the dark and strung along with breadcrumbs to lead them to the ultimate revelation (which I'm not sure of yet).  Starting from complete ignorance, e.g. the player doesn't know where they are, who they are, how they got there (just like vanilla Minecraft ;).  The player will be given a message and an objective which will then lead to the next message and objective. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n1. The first IO Block will spawn near the player's start/spawn, \"You are not safe, the dark brings danger.  I can help you survive.\".\r\n2. Objective message, \"Right Click the glowing object.\" \r\n3. Right clicking the IO block reveals a gift of a set of simple tools and supplies.\r\n4. Objective message, \"Survive the night\".\r\n5. The next day the player receives a new message, \"We can help each other.  Please bring sand.\"\r\n6. Objective message, \"Deliver 100 Sand.\"\r\n7. The player is rewarded with a small stack of tech blocks.\r\netc....\r\n\r\nThis will go on asking the player for objects and the IO block providing rewards until the player has been guiding in the construction of a \"Home Base\" made of Tech Blocks.  Then the players objectives will expand to include exploration of the surface world and the construction of additional bases.  The unformed idea I have is that ultimately the player is either providing supplies for his home world in another dimension or that for an unknown reason he is immortal and trapped in this limbo and that the messages are actually from himself and the objectives he has given himself are there just to keep him from going crazy.  Every so many years he loses his memory, but he never dies... I know, it's weak for now, but I think there is something there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Plugin for experimenting with MineCraft bukkit API"}
